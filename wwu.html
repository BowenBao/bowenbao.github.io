<p><strong>Qualifying Examination</strong></p>
<p>A qualifying exam covering CSCI 509, 510, 511, and 512 will be given to the student after&#160;completion of those courses. To be advanced to candidacy in the MS program in computer science the student must pass the qualifying exam. The student is responsible for requesting of the faculty that the qualifying exam be administered when the conditions have been met.</p>
<p><strong>Advancement to Candidacy</strong></p>
<p>Students are advanced to candidacy when they have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of completing their program of study. The student must have completed the core curriculum courses with a B or better GPA and must have passed the qualifying exam. Students are recommended for candidacy by the Graduate Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Elective Courses</strong></p>
<p>If possible, the student should take elective courses in support of their area of research.</p>
<p><strong>Research Experience</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the four core courses and&#160;six elective courses, all students in the MS in computer science program are required to take three research experience courses. The student should register for one of these courses each of the last three terms of study in the MS program. The three research experience courses are tied to one of a number of ongoing projects in the computer science department. Effectively, the student is joining that research team effort by registering for these courses. As such, the student should discuss their intentions with the faculty members involved in that project prior to registering for these courses. The research experience courses are numbers CSCI 601, CSCI 602 and CSCI 603. The student must take the qualifying exam no later than the quarter in which the student is registered for CSCI 601. To receive credit for CSCI 603, the student must write a research paper that is submitted to a refereed conference or journal with advisor approval.</p>
<p><strong>Total Credit Hours Required for the MS Degree in Computer Science</strong></p>
<p>Core Courses:&#160;4 courses x 4 credits =&#160;16 credits Graduate Seminar:&#160;Variable, 3 to 6 credit hours&#160;Elective Courses:&#160;6 courses x 4 credits = 24 credits Research Experience Courses: 3 courses x 4 credits = 12 credits Total: 58 credits</p>

<p>Students who have completed an undergraduate degree and who meet the requirements of the Graduate School and who show evidence of superior scholarship are invited to apply for admission to the graduate program in computer science. Students may be admitted into the computer science master's degree program in one of three ways: full admit, full admit with prerequisite course work, and provisional admit. Students who have a sufficient background in computer science, i.e. an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and who meet the general requirements of the Graduate School can be given a "full admit." Due to the nature of this field of study, it is often the case that students with an undergraduate degree in an area other than computer science seek admission to the graduate program in computer science. Such students usually require a number of prerequisite undergraduate courses before they can embark on their graduate studies. If they meet the other requirements of the Graduate School, such students can usually be given a "full admit with prerequisite course work." The student is admitted into the graduate program but is required to complete a number of undergraduate prerequisite courses. Other constraints may be placed on such admissions, such as a minimum acceptable grade(s) for the prerequisites and perhaps a time frame for completion of the prerequisites. The exact nature of the composition of the prerequisite course work will be determined on a case by case basis. In rare cases, students who do not meet the general requirements of the graduate school, for example do not have the required minimum GPA, can be given a "provisional admit" provided their background is such that it indicates a high probability of success in the program.<br />
In case of provisional admission, the program advisor may interview the candidate individually and consider the following factors:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>Related background knowledge and work experience</li>
	<li>Classes taken since graduation</li>
	<li>Reference letters</li>
	<li>GRE&#160;scores</li>

				            A 3.0 undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) in the last 90-quarter or 60-semester hours of study. In order for post-baccalaureate credit to be included in the GPA computation, the coursework must be upper division. Post-baccalaureate coursework at community colleges will not be included in the GPA used for admission. Applicants with advanced degrees from accredited institutions are generally, at the discretion of the Graduate School, considered to have met GPA requirements. <br />
<p>International students must submit official translations to English of all transcripts and diplomas from all post-secondary institutions attended. Documents must be issued within two years at the time of application. All international transcripts must be submitted to World Education Service (WES) for authentication and course-by-course evaluation. To be considered official, transcripts must be in sealed envelopes prepared by the university or college; attested/certified copies prepared by the institution may be accepted if originals cannot be provided by the institution.<br />
EXCEPTION:<br />
Applicants attending institutions in China must request official transcripts from the Ministry-authorized verification offices listed below; transcripts directly from an institution cannot be considered official.</p>
