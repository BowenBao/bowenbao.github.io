<h4>Degree Description</h4>
                            The Master of Science in Computer Science program in the School of ENCS is a thesis program and requires 30 credit hours, including 21 hours of graded course work and 9 credits of thesis research (CS 700). The coursework and research are in the general areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networks and computer graphics. Sophisticated facilities are available for instruction and research. Teaching and research assistantships are available for qualified students. Before undertaking graduate study in computer science, the student should have completed a baccalaureate degree substantially similar to the BSCS degree described below in the BSCS schedule of studies. Students from other academic disciplines are encouraged to apply, however such students will be required to take or have taken the equivalent of the following courses: CS 317, CS 360 and CS 450, including all prerequisites for these courses. An undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 is a minimum for admission to the MS program. The WSU Vancouver MS in Computer Science is designed and administered separately from the MS program in Pullman. If you designate the WSU Pullman program as your main objective, you will not be automatically considered by the Vancouver program unless you submit the specific documentation requested on our "How to Apply" web page (http://encs.vancouver.wsu.edu/how-apply). Except in rare cases, only those who indicate WSU Vancouver as their main objective will be prompted to submit any missing documentation so our Selection Committee can review their completed applications.
<h2>Degree requirements</h2>
<p>The Master of Science in Computer Science requires 30 credit hours, including 21 hours of graded course work and 9 credits of thesis research (CS 700).</p>
<p>Each student is expected to complete a significant research project and submit a thesis adhering to the formatting requirements of the student's advisory committee and to the requirements of the Graduate School. The thesis work should be submitted for publication prior to scheduling the thesis defense. It is the student's responsibility to meet the deadlines specified by the Graduate School and to have the thesis printed, photocopied, and distributed. One bound copy of the thesis must be provided to the School of Engineering and Computer Science as part of its library.</p>
<p>The 21 semester hour credits of graded course work are subject to the restrictions listed below:</p>
<ul><li>A maximum of six credits of 400-level course work</li>
<li>A maximum of one 3-credit Directed Study (CS 595) course</li>
<li>A maximum of six graduate-level transfer credits are allowed</li>
</ul><p>Two 400-level courses are permitted in the student's MSCS program. These courses are to be chosen in consultation with the advisor. However, CS 402 cannot be used for the program, nor can conjoint courses (those listed 400/500). That is, students must take the 500 level-course if they wish to use it in their graduate program of study. Undergraduate courses listed as admission requirements cannot be counted towards the MSCS degree.</p>
<p>Students planning to defend their thesis must enroll in two credits of CS 700 during the semester in which they defend.</p>

TOEFL scores (international students): These must be sent directly from ETS to WSU. The Washington State University school code is 4705; there is no department code. <br />
                            The minimum acceptable TOEFL score for the School of ENCS are: 550 with a score of 50 in each of the subtests on the paper-based test (TOEFL); 213 on the computerized test (TOEFLC), and 80 on the internet-based test (TOEFLI). Since it normally takes 4 to 6 weeks (or more) for TOEFL computer scores to be received by the Graduate School from ETS, it is highly recommended that you send a paper copy to both the Graduate School and the School of ENCS to be used as an unofficial copy until the official copy arrives.
