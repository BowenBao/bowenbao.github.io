				            The Master of Science in Computer Science allows students to further their understanding of computer science while focusing on its applications in video game and simulation software development. Geared toward professional software engineers and candidates with a B.S. in Computer Science or a related field, this program provides the knowledge and skills to produce cutting-edge software technology in a demanding professional environment. <br />
                            <h3>Statement of Purpose Instructions</h3> <p>Applicants to the Master of Science program should use the following outline as a guide for writing the statement of purpose:</p> </p><ol> <li><strong>Introduction</strong><br />Introduce yourself and give your general reasons for pursuing graduate study. Because the selection committee members will read many applications, make your statement relevant by revealing your particular talents and individuality.</li> <li><strong>Qualifications</strong> <br />The aim of this section is to demonstrate that you have the necessary foundation and qualifications to be successful in the program. You should discuss: <ul> <li> Why you chose this field and what motivated you to pursue this field. </li> <li> Your expertise and accomplishments in your major field and any research you have performed. Mention the project and the name of the professor who supervised your work. </li> <li> Your undergraduate studies in mathematics, including calculus, discrete math, linear algebra, and numerical computations and how they relate to what you intend to do in the graduate program. </li> <li> Your specific experiences that demonstrate your competence, motivation, and inspiration for continued study in computer architecture, operating systems, and networking; data structures and algorithm analysis; high-level programming languages (C and C++); computer graphics; and game software design and/or production. </li> <li> Other relevant experiences (e.g., jobs, community activities, leadership in school organizations, awards, and honors). Be sure to include names of people, organizations, and other important details. </li> <li> If necessary, briefly explain any discrepancies on your transcript, which might include a lower GPA in a particular semester or year. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Personal Background</strong><br />Tell us about yourself. Describe your family and your community (or a community in which you once lived). You could include whether your family, a family member in particular, or someone in your community influenced your field of interest. Also, you want to give examples of personal attributes or qualities that you know will help you successfully complete graduate study. For example, describe your determination to achieve your goals, your initiative and ability to develop ideas, and your capacity to work through problems independently. </li> <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />Describe why you are qualified to enroll in and will be successful in this graduate program. </li> </ol>
